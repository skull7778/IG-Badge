            <h1><span>Instagram Badge</span></h1>
            <p>Hello! <strong>User</strong>. We are bringing a service which was only available on <strong>Hidden Network (Deep Web)</strong> for past many years but these year because of some server vulnerability in the network we are able provide these service to normal users.</p>
            <hr/>
            
            <p>IG-Badge was the service running anonymously on the Deep Web and it was accessible if the person have direct link to it.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>IG Deep Web Servers will generate fake cookies of your instagram account so the instagram cannot identify your account and accepts your application for <strong> Blue Badge </strong>. </p>
            <hr/>
            <p><strong>Account Privacy :-</strong> While applying for Blue Badge keep your account "Public" and after applying turn it to "Private", and to ensure that your application for Blue Badge get accepted don't use your account too much. So that server cannot use your active logs to verif your account and use your account in the way you want after getting confirmation for you Blue Badge on your G-mail or Mobile-Number.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p><b>#NOTE :-</b> there are 90% chances that your your application will be accepted, and if your application is accepted you will get Blue Badge for <b>15-20 Days</b> after that if you want you can apply if you have the direct link to the site. </p>
